Analyses used in publication: ""

1) Folder "Analysis_1_HPLCDat_CA19" contains analyses and output related to QC-filter HPLC data from the CA_2019_732PI trial. 
  Data from these analyses are included in Supplemental Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 3. 
2) Folder "Analysis_2_FigsHPLCdat_CA19" contains analyses and output related HPLC data was further filtered checking for appropriate HPLC data for each color category.
   Test of normality were completed and Outliers were removed here. 
   The counts of each color score were calculated for supplemental 4.
3) Folder "Analysis_3_HPLCDat_WI18" contains analyses and output related to QC-filter HPLC data from the WI_2018_432 trial.
     Data from these analyses are included in Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 1. 
4) Folder "Analysis_4_FigsHPLCdat_WI18" contains analyses and output related contains analyses and output related HPLC data was further filtered checking for appropriate HPLC data for each color category.
5) Folder "Analysis_5_DescribePhenotypeData_WI18" Removes outliers from the WI_2018_432 trial, calculates the mean for each carotenoid. Mean separation for Supplmental Figure 2a,b is included here as welll as the boxplot in the figure. These analyses include the correlation test found in Table 1. Phenotype file for  Genomic Prediction and GWA analyses was created during these analyses. 
6)  Folder: "Analysis_6_DescribePhenotypeData_CA19" contains analyses and output related to mean separation between colors, and the boxplot found in Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental table 6. The correlation and carotenoid means for Table 1 were calculated with this analysis. Core color carotenoid comparisons found in Supplemental Figure 2 were calculated in this analysis. A comparison of HPLC data (i.e., mean separation and correlation) found in supplemental table 7 was calculated here).
